What is this?
=============

This is experimental IntelliJ IDEA plugin to visualize java project using d3.js library.<br/>
This plugin will only work within host intellij-eval plugin.

I spawned this project from my experimental code. There are really two plugins inside:
 - project tag cloud. Shows "tag cloud" of words used in project. It would be interesting to see if makes
 more sense if only include class/method names.
 - treemap package navigation.


Why?
====
It's fun (and potentially useful) to see your project in a "different way" and d3.js is nice library to play with.


How to use
===========
It's not ready for "production" and I don't know how it will evolve (if it will),
so it look like it makes sense to write any instructions.
Please read source code or drop me a message.
